# Knucklebones Game (React Native)

This is a **Knucklebones** minigame replica from the game _Cult of the Lamb_, built entirely with **React Native**—without using any game engines like Unity or Godot.  
The goal of this project was to explore the capabilities of React Native beyond traditional applications, and prove that it's possible to create simple and fun games using just the core tools of the ecosystem.

## Features

- **React Native with TypeScript**: Strong typing for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Reanimated**: For smooth, performant animations.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management across the game.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating reusable logic (like audio handling).
- **Custom Assets**: Game-specific images, sounds, and fonts integrated into the app.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized project structure with modular components and screens.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have React Native set up on your machine. If not, follow the installation guide from the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eccianime/knucklebones.git
   cd knucklebones-game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   npm run android              # For Android
   npm run ios                  # For iOS
   ```

## Notes

- This project was built without any game engines or physics libraries—just React Native and its ecosystem.

- All game logic (dice rolling, score rules, interactions) was manually implemented.

- The visual style and game assets are inspired by Cult of the Lamb, used for educational and experimental purposes only.
